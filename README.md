<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

**Bring attention to lesser known artistic communities**

Many new and existing artists are deliberately working to express their art
universe and publicize their work. However, it‚Äôs always challenging to catch
people‚Äôs attention, and only a few succeed. To address and solve this problem,
we aim to bring attention to lesser-known artists and artistic communities
through giving equal opportunities to showcase everyone's artwork and even
funding them directly through our platform Artchive.

<!-- FEATURES -->

## Features
Artchive has 2 pages.

The main page is a gallery of the latest artworks by artists with diverse
backgrounds and histories. Every artwork shown is randomly ordered so that
every artist can have an equal opportunity to be showcased. The artworks are
scraped from other websites that has trending artworks. We intentionally left
out all of the information except the artwork itself, which might help identify
the artist to prevent people from having any assumptions before looking at the
information of the art by clicking it.

The information page shows the artwork and its descriptions. People can see
which artist created this artwork and see other artwork created by the same
artist that may interest them. This way, artists have a chance to feature their
other artworks and concepts that they have been working on. On the other hand,
the audience can find out the genres that they are potentially interested in
and find any other existing artworks that may interest them, like Spotify‚Äôs
song recommendation algorithm.
